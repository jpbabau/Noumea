# NOUMEA framework

The NOUMEA framework is a research prototype to model [WPS](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wps), to edit WPS workflows, to generate WPS Java code and to deploy WPS jar on [GeoServer](http://geoserver.org/).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See the Intallation Guide and the User Manual for more details on how to use the different tools.

### Prerequisites
